**********************************
MySQL Target Algorithm Evaluator Plugin Readme
**********************************
To use the MySQLDB TAE in another AEATK project you should copy it's contents (not the folder) 
into the ROOT or lib folder of the other project.  This is recommended because this folder
does not contain all the necessary jars and so the ./mysql-worker and ./dzq scripts won't work 
without them. 

Finally note that you should not mix and match AEATK versions between master and slave,
and between this plugin and your AEATK project.
