2.1

 * Fix CRAN errors in tests.
 
2.0

 * Minimum R version is 2.15. 

 * Elitist irace by default, it can be disabled with parameter --elitist 0. 
   (Leslie Pérez Cáceres, Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * The parameter --test-type gains two additional values:

     t-test-bonferroni (t-test with Bonferroni's correction for multiple
                        comparisons), 
     t-test-holm (t-test with Holm's correction for multiple comparisons)

   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * MPI does not create log files with --debug-level 0.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * For simplicity, the parallel-irace-* scripts do not use an auxiliary
   `tune-main` script.  For customizing them, make a copy and edit them
   directly.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * New parameters:
   
   --target-runner-retries : Retry target-runner this many times in case
                             of error. 
                                                   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * We print diversity measures after evaluating on each instance:
   (Leslie Pérez Cáceres)

   - Kendall's W (also known as Kendall's coefficient of concordance) If 1,
     all candidates have ranked in the same order in all instances.  If 0, the
     ranking of each candidate on each instance is essentially random.  

             W = Friedman / (m * (k-1))
   
   - Spearman's rho: average (Spearman) correlation coefficient computed on the
     ranks of all pairs of raters. If there are no repeated data values, a
     perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or -1 occurs when each of the variables
     is a perfect monotone function of the other.

 * Many internal and external interfaces have changed. For example, now we
   consistently use 'scenario' to denote the settings passed to irace and
   'configuration' instead of 'candidate' to denote the parameter settings
   passed to the target algorithm. Other changes are:

   parameters$boundary -> parameters$domain
   hookRun             -> targetRunner
   hookEvaluate        -> targetEvaluator
   tune-conf           -> scenario.txt
   instanceDir         -> trainInstancesDir
   instanceFile        -> trainInstancesFile
   testInstanceDir     -> testInstancesDir
   testInstanceFile    -> testInstancesFile

 * Minimal example of configuring a MATLAB program
   (thanks to Esteban Diaz Leiva)

 * Paths to files or directories given in the scenario file are relative to the
   scenario file (except for --log-file, which is an output file and it is
   relative to --exec-dir). Paths given in the command-line are relative to the
   current working directory. Given

      $ cat scenario/scenario.txt
      targetRunner <- "./target-runner"
      $ irace -s scenario/scenario.txt

   irace will search for "./scenario/target-runner", but given

      $ irace -s scenario/scenario.txt --target-runner ./target-runner
   
   irace will search for "./target-runner".      (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * New command-line wrapper for Windows installed at
   'system.file("bin/irace.bat", package="irace")'
   (thanks to Anthony Antoun)                                        

 * Budget can be specified as maximum time (maxTime, --max-time) consumed by
   the target algorithm. See the documentation for the details about how this
   is handled.
   (Leslie Pérez Cáceres, Manuel López-Ibáñez)


1.07

 * The best configurations found, either at the end or at each iteration of an
   irace run, can now be applied to a set of test instances different from the
   training instances. See options testInstanceDir, testInstanceFile,
   testNbElites, and testIterationElites. (Leslie Pérez Cáceres, Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * The R interfaces of hookRun, hookEvaluate and hookRunParallel have changed.
   See help(hook.run.default) and help(hook.evaluate.default) for examples of
   the new interfaces.

 * Printing of race progress now reports the actual configuration and instance
   IDs, and numbers are printed in a more human-readable format.
   (Leslie Pérez Cáceres, Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * Reduce memory use for very large values of maxExperiments.  
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez, thanks to Federico Caselli for identifying the issue)

 * New option --load-balancing (loadBalancing) for disabling load-balancing
   when executing jobs in parallel. Load-balancing makes better use of
   computing resources, but increases communication overhead. If this overhead
   is large, disabling load-balancing may be faster.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez, thanks to Federico Caselli for identifying the issue)

 * The option --parallel in Windows now uses load-balancing by default.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * The wall-clock time after finishing each task is printed in the output.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez, thanks to Federico Caselli for providing an initial
   patch)



1.06

 * Fix bug that could introduce spurious whitespace when printing the
   final configurations. (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * Fix bug if there are more initial candidates than needed for the
   first race. (Leslie Pérez Cáceres, Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * New configuration options, mainly for R users:
                    
   - hookRunParallel: Optional R function to provide custom
     parallelization of hook.run.

   - hookRunData: Optional data passed to hookRun. This is ignored by
     the default hookRun function, but it may be used by custom hookRun R
     functions to pass persistent data around.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

1.05

 * New option --version. (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * Terminate early if there is no sufficient budget to run irace with
   the given settings. (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * The option --parallel (without --mpi) now works under Windows.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez, thanks to Pablo Valledor Pellicer for testing
   it)

 * Improved error handling when running under Rmpi. Now irace will
   terminate as soon as the master node detects at least one failed
   slave node. This avoids irace reporting two times the same error.
   Also, irace will print all the unique errors returned by all slaves
   and not just the first one.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * Forbidden configurations may be specified in terms of constraints
   on their values. Forbidden configurations will never be evaluated by irace. 
   See --forbidden-file and inst/templates/forbidden.tmpl.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * New option --recovery-file (recoveryFile) allows resuming a
   previous irace run. (Leslie Pérez Cáceres)

 * The confidence level for the elimination test is now
   configurable with parameter --confidence. (Leslie Pérez Cáceres)

 * Much more robust handling of relative/absolute paths. Improved support
   for Windows. (Leslie Pérez Cáceres, Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * Provide better error messages for incorrect parameter
   descriptions. (Manuel López-Ibáñez)
    Examples:

    x "" i (0, 0)       # lower and upper bounds are the same
    x "" r (1e-4, 5e-4) # given digits=2, ditto
    x "" i (-1, -2)     # lower bound must be smaller than upper bound
    x "" c ("a", "a")   # duplicated values
 
 * Print elapsed time for calls to hook-run if debugLevel >=1.
   (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

 * examples/hook-run-python/hook-run: A multi-purpose hook-run written
   in Python. (Franco Mascia)

 * Parallel mode in an SGE cluster (--sge-cluster) is more
   robust. (Manuel López-Ibáñez)

1.04

 * Replace obsolete package multicore by package parallel
   (requires R >= 2.14.0)

 * Use load-balancing (mc.preschedule = FALSE) in mclapply.

1.03

 * Use reg.finalizer to finish Rmpi properly without clobbering
   .Last().

 * Remove uses of deprecated as.real().

 * Nicer error handling in readParameters.

 * Add hypervolume (multi-objective) example.

 * Fix several bugs in the computation of similar candidates.

1.02

 * More concise output.

 * The parameters expName and expDescription are now useless and they
   were removed.

 * Faster computation of similar candidates (Jeremie Dubois-Lacoste
   and Leslie Pérez Cáceres).

 * Fix bug when saving instances in tunerResults$experiments.

 * irace.cmdline ("--help") does not try to quit R anymore.

1.01

 * Fix bug caused by file.exists (and possibly other functions)
   not handling directory names with a trailing backslash or slash on
   Windows.
 
 * Fix bug using per-instance parameters (Leslie Pérez Cáceres).

 * Fix bug when reading initial candidates from a file.
