SGE cluster:

This mode requires Grid Engine commands qsub and qstat. The comand
qsub should return a message that contains the string: `Your job
JOBID`. The command `qstat -j JOBID` should return nonzero if JOBID
has finished, otherwise it should return zero.

The option `--sge-cluster 1` will launch as many calls of `targetRunner` as
possible and use `qstat` to wait for cluster jobs. The user *must*
call `qsub` from `targetRunner` with the appropriate configuration for
their cluster, otherwise `targetRunner` will not submit jobs to the
cluster. In this mode, irace must run in the submission node, and
hence, qsub should not be used to invoke irace.
You also need to create a separate target-evaluator
script to parse the results of the targetRunner and return them to irace,
and set targetEvaluator in scenario.txt or use the command-line option
--target-evaluator so irace can find the target-evaluator program.
